# RetirementFundProblem


I would like to ask other challengers for the tips for the Investors strategies, probably Funds' strategies and offer them a possibility of collaboration on finalizing and publishing it. I also think about organizing own challenge - narrow one: just inviting challengers to send their Funds' and Investors' strategies.

###Plan to improve the Retirement Fund Problem: 
A) Introduce more FDs (they could be only Conservative and Aggressive) 
B) Introduce more FDs' strategies 
C) Introduce private/independent investors
D) Introduce strategies for decision being private/independent or steered by Fund
E) Introduce strategies for choosing pools privately/independently
